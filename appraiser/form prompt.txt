By signing below, I acknowledge that my item will be auctioned during the SOLD OUT! Comedy Show.

I understand that my item will only be sold if it reaches the listing price which will be higher than the sale price you chose. Site fees, transaction fees and taxes will be added to the sale price to create the listing price.

If sold, I will receive the exact sale amount I've specified—no more, no less.

Any amount above sale price will be retained by SOLD OUT! Comedy.

I agree to have the item sold in the show format as determined by the production team.

The production team has final say regarding my participation in the show.

All sales are final with no returns or refunds.

I release SOLD OUT! Comedy from any liability related to my item or participation.
