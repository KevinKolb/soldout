# SOLD OUT! Comedy

The website for SOLD OUT! Comedy — live comedy meets live shopping.

Static site hosted on GitHub Pages at [www.soldoutcomedy.com](https://www.soldoutcomedy.com),
deployed automatically from `main` by [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

## Structure

```
index.html            Homepage (currently the "coming soon" placeholder)
CNAME                 Custom domain for GitHub Pages

assets/               All static assets
  css/style.css       Site stylesheet
  images/             Logos, photos, social icons, clip videos
  videos/             Background video clips
  data/               Site content as XML (shows, taglines, videos, musicvids)

live/                 Show-day pages: prop check-in form, prop display, QR codes
admin/                Browser tools for editing the XML content in assets/data
backstage/            Redirect to the Notion backstage workspace
tools/                Local development helpers (not used by the deployed site)
archive/              Previous homepage and its alternate themes
```

## Content

Site content lives in `assets/data/*.xml` rather than in the HTML. Asset paths inside
those XML files are root-relative (`/assets/images/...`) so they resolve correctly from
any page, whatever folder it sits in.

Edit the XML by hand, or use the browser tools in `admin/`, which generate an updated
file for you to download and commit.

## Local development

The pages fetch XML over HTTP, so `file://` will not work — serve the folder instead:

```sh
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

To use the admin tools with save-to-disk support, run the helper server instead:

```sh
python tools/dev-server.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080/admin/addshows.html>.

## Deployment secrets

`live/input.html` and `live/prop.html` ship with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens in place of their
Airtable and EmailJS credentials. The deploy workflow substitutes them from GitHub repository
secrets, so the real keys are never committed. The build fails if a secret is missing or a
placeholder survives substitution.

Never replace a placeholder with a real value in a committed file — these pages are served
as plain static HTML, so anything hardcoded there is readable by every visitor.

Required secrets:

`AIRTABLE_API_KEY`, `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`, `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME`,
`EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`, `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`, `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
