MERCH CHECK-IN
SOLD OUT! COMEDY SHOW (STAGE EDITION)

From one hour prior to the start of the show, until 15 minutes before the show starts, our panel of appraisers evaluates the items brought in by audience members. These items will be auctioned off during the program.
The appraisers are also sizing up the audience members to determine where they will best fit into our improv/selling show.
Obviously this is all very subjective and is a major factor in determining how fun and successful a show is.
Each check-in should only take 2â€“3 minutes max. Keep it moving while still making them feel valued. Stay playful but authoritative.

Check-In Process
Greet the person and fill out both halves of a merch ticket/disclaimer as you go.
1. NAME
Get their first name and last initial.
2. BOX
If they didn't bring a mail ready box with them, provide one.
3. PRICE
Work with the audience member to determine the value of the item and the minimum amount they will sell their item for.

They will receive nothing or that exact amount. Make sure they know that anything over the amount they set will be given to SOLD OUT! Comedy.
They may want to set the price higher than they initially thought, but then it might not sell. The final price is their choice. It's a gamble for them. They are gamblers. We are the house.

4. PARTICIPANT
Ask the audience member if they would like to participate on stage, in a random scene, to sell their item.
5. SCENE
Consult the script to determine which scene the person and/or item should go into.

Do not let the person know what scene they are going into unless you feel the item doesn't fit in any of the scenes or the scenes are full. In that case, let them know that you think their item fits in the rapid sales section at the end of the show.
They can have a cast member or a friend auction their item, but strongly encourage them to participate in the sale.
They will get one minute to auction their item anyway they want.

Notes

Merch ticket/disclaimer has a unique id on it. Have them sign both halves and give them their half for reference. Check off the item in the script. Place your half in the relevant scene section of the accordion file. Write ID number in box.
Take the item if it's in a regular scene. Have them hold it if it's going in the rapid sales section.
No item is rejected unless it breaks a rule of the selling service.
